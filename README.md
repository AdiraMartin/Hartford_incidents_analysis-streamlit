# Hartford incidents analysis in streamlit
This repository showcases the enhanced version of my final project on Hartford Incident Analysis. In this project, I have developed an interactive application using Streamlit, taking the analysis to the next level. 

The application allows users to explore and analyze incident data in Hartford, providing insights into crime patterns, trends, and hotspots. Through intuitive visualizations and interactive features, users can gain a deeper understanding of crime incidents and make data-informed decisions.

By leveraging the power of Streamlit, I have transformed my initial project into a user-friendly app that enables easy data exploration and enhances the accessibility of the analysis. With a clean and intuitive interface, users can navigate through different neighborhoods, categories of incidents, and time periods to uncover meaningful patterns and correlations.

This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for the Hartford Incident Analysis application, containing the necessary code, data, and documentation. It reflects my continuous efforts to improve and refine my final project, presenting a polished and user-centric application that demonstrates my skills in data analysis, visualization, and application development.

Through this repository, I aim to share my work and contribute to the field of crime analysis and data-driven decision-making. I encourage collaboration, feedback, and further enhancements to advance the capabilities and insights offered by the application.
